Med Guide is designed to make accessing medicines and medical information quick and
simple. It features a Prescription Scanner that scans prescriptions using OCR technology,
identifies the medicines, and locates nearby pharmacies with stock. The Medicine Search
Engine lets users search for medicines by name, providing details like uses, side effects,
pricing, and availability. By combining these two tools, Med Guide streamlines the process of
finding and buying medicines, reducing delays and helping users make informed healthcare
choices with ease. It aims to enhance convenience and improve patient care access.
